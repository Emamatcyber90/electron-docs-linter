## Electron Naming Conventions

From https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/5010#issuecomment-206749071

> The basic idea is, the name of API should match how you use them. So use CamelCase when it is a class, or mixedCase when you want to call its methods.

* When the module itself is a class, like `BrowserWindow` => use CamelCase
* When the module is a set of APIs, like `clipboard` => use mixedCase
* When the API is a property of object, and it is complex enough to be in a separate chapter, like `win.webContents` => use mixedCase
* For other non-module APIs, use natural titles, like `<webview> Tag` or `Process Object`.

> This follows the style of Node's APIs.
